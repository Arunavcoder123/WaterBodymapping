Water body mapping using Google earth engine.
Download the .txt file and then copy the script to the Google Earth Engine script editor. Define a region of interest(polygon) and then apply any threshold value (-14dB to -20dB).
Run this script. 
A graph plot will be made. Click on any points generated in the graph and the imagery for that particular date will be downloaded.
